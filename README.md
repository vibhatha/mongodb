MongoDb important Scripts

The setMongo bat file is for setting up the environment to start the MongoDb server in windows.
The runMongo bat file runs the MongoDb Shell

Depending on the installation folder please modifiy the neccessary paths to run MongoDB in windows.
I found myself little bit troublesome doing this and I created these bats so that you can do the task quite easiy.
Hope it would be a help for a begginer like me.
